Info: 
 * This was just a simple foray into javascript and the p5 library. I had watched a few of TheCodingTrain's videos and wanted to see the differences first-hand between C++ with Qt versus p5.js. It was a fun experience, and I definitely may use it in the future for quick animations!

Note: 
 * The speed of the ball and the size of all the items in screen change depending on the size of the browser window. It will resize automatically as well. Unfortunately, the proportions don't look perfect at all different window sizes, but I tried to find a happy medium. Fun fact: If the window is very short in height but long in width, the ball will phase right through the paddle.

Things to add:
 * A toggle-able AI for one or both sides.

Libraries:
 * This makes use of the p5.js libraries: https://p5js.org/
